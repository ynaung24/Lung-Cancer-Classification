## Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of lung cancer based on patient data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `cancer.csv`. It contains various features related to patient demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Smoking**: Yes/No
- **Yellow Fingers**: Yes/No
- **Anxiety**: Yes/No
- **Peer Pressure**: Yes/No
- **Chronic Disease**: Yes/No
- **Fatigue**: Yes/No
- **Allergy**: Yes/No
- **Wheezing**: Yes/No
- **Alcohol Consuming**: Yes/No
- **Coughing**: Yes/No
- **Shortness of Breath**: Yes/No
- **Swallowing Difficulty**: Yes/No
- **Chest Pain**: Yes/No
- **Lung Cancer**: Yes/No (Target Variable)
